Have fun,

This is not working version !!!
We just messing around...

No edit by Edynu (Unydee) - just retargeted for Visual Studio 2019 and add Includes
You maybe need to retarget includes to your folder !!!

Here : https://i.ibb.co/CvK595D/includes.png

You will need add to C:/Users/*yourUser/lib -> lua5.1.dll.lib in root folder of repository (or double click it in visual studio and it will tell you path where you should put this file)
